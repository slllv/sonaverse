	<h1 >The Sonaverse</h1>
	<p>The Sonaverse is a liminal space where all virtual characters are meant to reside. As the Sonaverse grows, more new exciting features will be added, in order to allow creators and characters to interact within this space! We will start by adding recognized original characters from independent creators, but as the site grows, we plan on adding authentication features and character submission forms, as well as exciting games! </p>
